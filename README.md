# Custom Linux Commands

These commands work mostly as macros.

To get the custom commands in your machine run the installer


- Types `ls -l` in the directory that you typed, without the need to visit that directory directly:
    ```bash
    $ peak <path/to/directory>
    ```

- Clears the screen and runs `ls -l`:
    ```bash
    $ cllear
    ```
